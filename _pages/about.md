# About Me

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Eric Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). Before that, I received my B.S. in computer science from ACM Honor Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was a research intern at UC Berkeley, where I worked closely with [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

My research interest includes distributed systems, machine learning systems and parallel computing. I have been working on [Alpa](https://github.com/**alpa-projects/alpa) from the very beginning.
